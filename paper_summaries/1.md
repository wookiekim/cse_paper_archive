##### Why did I read this paper?
Partly implemented in current area of research (3D matching)

#### Paper keywords / Context
Correspondences, Geometry, Camera Intrinsic, Order-aware network, Correspondence Outlier Rejection, Relative Pose estimation

#### What problem does this paper try to solve?
Main Task at hand: Use NN to infer the probability of each correspondence as an inlier, then recover relative pose by regressing the essential matrix for **two-view** geometry estimation. 

Problem to solve: Sparse matches have no well-defined neighbours(unlike point clouds), and there are no relation between correspondences since they are unordered and have no stable relations to be captured. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce well-defined neighbours instead of heuristic neighbours in the form of **learned clusters** which are permutation invariant, and model (to learn) relations between correspondences (clusters) for better performance.

#### Main contributions of the paper
Introduce DiffPool and DiffUnpool layers 
* to capture local context of unordered sparse correspondences in a learnable manner
* "Local context" : well-defined neighbours

Order-Aware Filtering block (with collaborative use of DiffPool operator)
* exploits the complex global context of sparse correspondences

Significantly improves relative pose estimation accuracy on both outdoor and indoor datasets.

Question I may want to ask the author

Terms that I did not understand, and their usage

Figures - well labeled? with error bars?

implicit assumptions, missing citations, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques?
