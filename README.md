## The Three-pass approach

### The First pass
Quick scan to get a bird eye's view of the paper
* can decice whether to do more passes
* 5~10 minutes

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section & sub-section headings (ONLY)
3. Glance at methematical content (if any) to determine underlying theoretical foundations
4. Read the Conclusions
5. Glance over the references, (mentally) ticking off ones already read

By the end, the following five Cs can be answered:
1. Category
* What type of paper is this? Measurement? Analysis of existing system? Description of research prototype?
2. Context
* Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness 
* Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions
* What are the paper's main contributions?
5. Clarity
* Is the paper well written?
