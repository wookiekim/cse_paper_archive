# cse_paper_archive
my own archive of cse papers with summarizations.

Each paper will have from 1 to 3 different summary files, each following the scheme outlined in the following paper.

* The following article has been downloaded in this repository in case the link changes.

## The Three-pass approach

### The First pass
Quick scan to get a bird eye's view of the paper
* can decice whether to do more passes
* 5~10 minutes

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section & sub-section headings (ONLY)
3. Glance at methematical content (if any) to determine underlying theoretical foundations
4. Read the Conclusions
5. Glance over the references, (mentally) ticking off ones already read

By the end, the following five Cs can be answered:
1. Category
* What type of paper is this? Measurement? Analysis of existing system? Description of research prototype?
2. Context
* Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness 
* Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions
* What are the paper's main contributions?
5. Clarity
* Is the paper well written?

### The Second pass
* Up to an hour for experienced readers
* Must be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper (with supporting evidence) to someone else
* Appropriate for a paper I am interested in, but outside my research specialty


Read with greater care, **ignoring details such as proofs**

Jot down key points, make comments in the margins
* terms that I didn't understand
* questions I may want to ask the author

Look carefully at the figures/diagrams/illustrations in the paper.
* Well Labeled?
* Are results shown with error bars (i.e. statistically significant?)

**Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading**



### The Third pass
* To FULLY understand the paper
  * especially if you are a reviewer
* Make take many hours for beginners
  * More than an hour or two for an experienced reader
* Should e able to reconstruct the tnire structure of paper from memory
* Identify strong and weak points
* Should become able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations, and potential issues with experimenal or analytical techniques.

Virtually re-implement the paper
* make the same assumption
* recreate the work
* compare recreation with the actual paper
  * Find out **ACTUAL INNOVATINONS, HIDDEN FAILINGS AND ASSUMPTINONS**

Requires great attention to detail
* Identify and challenge every every assumption in every statement
* Think about how I myself would present a particular idea

...This lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper
* Which I later can add to my repertoire of ot tools
  * Really, just reading ResNET and SENet thoroughly was enough to think of several presentation techniques
  * Code reimplementation --> may be enough to think up of several implementation techniques then

Also jot down ideas for future work

## Doing a literature survey
1. Use academic search engine (Google scholar, CiteSeer) + Well chosen keywords
* find 3~5 **recent highly cited papers** in the area
  * If you can find a survey in their related works, read the survey (lucky case)
2. Find shared citations and repeated author names
* Key papers and researchers in that area
* Download the key papers and set them aside
* Go to websites of key researchers and see where they've published recently
  * Which usually are top conferences in that field
3. Go to the identified top conferences, look through their recent proceedings

These collection of papers constitute the first version of my survey
* Make the passes through these papers
